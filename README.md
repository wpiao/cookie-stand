# Cookie Stand  

## Author: Wenhao Piao  

## Lab: 06 - Get started on the Salmon Cookies project - 1/27/2021  
In this lab, I created object literals and added required properties and methods to the objects. And then I used DOM manipulation methods to create the required elements.

## Lab: 07 - Add a constructor function to the cookie stand project - 1/30/2021 
In this lab, I refactored previous lab code by using JS constructor. In this way, the code is much cleaner and DRY. I used DOM manipulation methods such as `document.getElementById, document.createElement, appendChild` to create the required table. This table shows each location's cookies selling by the hour.  

## Lab: 08 - Work on styling the cookie stand project - 2/4/2021  
In this lab, I was working on styling the project. First, I added required elements to HTML files and then worked on styling from top to bottom, left to right. I used `float` to position the elements properly.

## Lab: 09 - Add a form to the cookie stand project - 2/6/2021  
In this lab, I added a form in the `sales.html` file and I added an event listener and an event handler in the `app.js` file to handle the form submission. When users fill in the form and submit it, it will add a row of data in the table and the footer row will be updated accordingly.

## Lab: 10b - Finish the salmon cookie stand project - 2/10/2021  
In this lab, I added final styling - font color, background color, etc.
